Dear Mr. {{surname}}<br /><br />

<b>Re: Your claim for Payment Protection Mis-selling</b><br /><br />


Thank you for your instructions to pursue a refund on your behalf.<br /><br />
In order to lodge your claim, we would be grateful if you could complete the following paperwork and return it in the prepaid envelope provided;<br />

<blockquote>
	<ul>
		<li>Sign and date the Form(s) of Authority</li>

		<li>Sign and date the Terms of Engagement - Our Copy</li>
	</ul>

We need a Form of Authority for each account you wish us to deal with.<br /><br />

Using the information you provided it is estimated your claim will be up to &pound;2500. If you are having problems completing any of this paperwork please call our advisors who will be more than happy to talk through this with you. Please note that the faster we receive the fully completed paperwork the faster we can progress your claim.<br /><br />

We can confirm that our representation to you will be on a strict 'no win no fee' basis. This means that we will not make any charge if we are unsuccessful with your claim. As discussed, in the event that we are successful, our only charge to you will be 25% of your total refunded costs.<br /><br />


<b>This charge is only deducted at the end of your claim from the amount that you are awarded. If we are not successful then there will be no charge for our services.</b><br /><br />

In the meantime we thank you for choosing Gregson & Brooke Ltd to represent you and we look forward to receiving your pack.<br /><br />
